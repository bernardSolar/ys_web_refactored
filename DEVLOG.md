# Development Log

## March 17, 2025 - Refactoring Project Review

### Completed Improvements

1. **MVC Architecture Implementation**
   - Created proper Models (User, Product, Order) with encapsulation
   - Implemented Controllers for handling API requests
   - Maintained existing views (to be improved later)

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Base Repository with common database operations
   - Specialized repositories for each entity (Product, Order, User)
   - Clean separation of data access from business logic

3. **Service Layer**
   - Created dedicated services (AuthService, OrderService, ProductService)
   - Encapsulated business logic away from controllers
   - Improved reusability of code

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Centralized Config class
   - More robust config loading and fallbacks

5. **Error Handling & Debugging**
   - More detailed error logging
   - Better exception handling
   - Graceful fallbacks for common errors

6. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed order placement functionality
   - Addressed order history display issues
   - Improved type handling throughout the codebase

### Areas for Future Improvement

1. **Frontend Modernization**
   - JavaScript code still uses traditional approach (no modules)
   - Could benefit from component-based architecture

2. **View Templates**
   - HTML/PHP are still mixed in view files
   - Should implement a templating system

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - No unit or integration tests yet
   - Would make further refactoring safer

4. **Dependency Injection**
   - Currently using simple instantiation
   - A proper DI container would improve testability

### Next Steps

- Add unit testing framework
- Begin refactoring front-end JavaScript
- Implement templating system for views
- Further improve error handling and logging

### Known Issues

- ~~Order placement was failing due to type handling issues~~ (Fixed)
- ~~Order history in user profile had display issues~~ (Fixed)
